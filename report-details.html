              <p>Teaching parents to conduct functional analyses and to implement functional communication training is
                an efficacious approach for treating socially maintained problem behavior (Derby et al., 1997). Research
                has found that delivering this assessment and intervention package via telehealth technologies is
                efficient and acceptable to caregivers in the United States (Wacker et al., 2013b).
              </p>
              <p> We replicated this work with families residing in rural and urban areas of eight countries. Two
                behavior therapists located in the United States conducted appointments in the participants’ native
                languages, using interpreters as needed. Parent-implemented functional analyses and treatment with
                functional communication training were highly effective in reducing problem behavior in children
                diagnosed with autism. Furthermore, parents rated the procedures as acceptable and indicated that the
                treatment would be effective with their children. These findings indicate that telehealth technologies
                are a viable option for clinicians to provide behavior analysis services to families around the world.
