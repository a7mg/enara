                                Traditional therapy settings face challenges due to the lack of customizable learning
                                plans and assistive technology, making it difficult to address the diverse needs of
                                neurodiverse children. Enara’s evidence-based treatment solutions for centers create
                                individualized learning plans using artificial intelligence.

                                Enara leverages AI for gaze detection, gesture tracking, voice recognition, and an
                                engaging rewarding system to reinforce children’s learning progress. Our platform
                                incorporates a gamified, secure, and interactive environment, enabling parents and
                                therapists to assess children’s progress in real-time, whether they are at home, in
                                therapy centers, or at school.

                                Therapists struggle with accurately measuring children’s progress and communicating with
                                all caregivers in a unified digital platform. They also encounter difficulties in
                                customizing treatment plans to meet the specific needs of each child and spend an
                                excessive amount of time on administrative duties.

                                Enara, with the help of AI, enables therapists to create learning programs tailored to
                                each child’s unique needs and developmental stage. These programs boost children’s
                                communication, motor, social, and academic skills. We also enhance therapy
                                sessions by simplifying progress tracking and data analysis, integrating AI and
                                animated games, and improving communication with parents.

                                resistance to therapy, limited access to monitoring therapy progress, and the high

                                Children often show slow progress and reluctance to treatment in traditional therapy
                                settings. Enara aims to change this with interactive AI and animated games that
                                recognize and respond to voice, gaze and targeted movement, encouraging active
                                participation. Through our fun and interactive activities, we address learning gaps
                                and help children develop confidence and independence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our personalized plans help children overcome learning obstacles and unlock their
                                full potential within a nurturing environment. By transforming therapy into an
                                enjoyable and dynamic experience, Enara helps them reach their learning milestones
                                at the appropriate developmental stages.
